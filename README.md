This calculator has got 2 versions.

V1 is the basic version for people who just want a calculater built using Tkinter(standard Python 3 library).
It doesn't have a modern UI nor can it ever have one.

V2 is the basic version for people who just want a calculator built using PyQT6(downloadable library).
This does have a better UI and can have a modern one.

I wanted to build a calculator app using HTML, CSS, and JS but... there are better ideas.
